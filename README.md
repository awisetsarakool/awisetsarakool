 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @awisetsarakool
 
I'm a passionate technology enthusiast making my way into the field of cybersecurity.

ðŸ‘€ Currently, I work as an IT Analyst with a strong background in help desk and software support, and Iâ€™m proficient in managing enterprise-scale Windows environments.
 As I expand my career, I am committed to deepening my expertise across multiple operating systems and building a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles.

ðŸŒ± This GitHub space is dedicated to my journey of learning and experimentation with automation and security tools. 

Right now, I'm focusing on:

--Python scripting: Developing automation skills to enhance efficiency and streamline tasks.

--Linux administration: Strengthening my capabilities to work across different operating systems.

Iâ€™m excited to connect with others in the tech community, share what I learn, and hopefully contribute to collaborative projects.

Thanks for visiting!
